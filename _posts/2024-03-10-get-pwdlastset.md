Have you ever needed to track when users last changed their passwords in Active Directory? Manually checking each user's password change date can be time-consuming and tedious. Luckily, with PowerShell, you can automate this task easily.

## Download here:
[Get-PwdLastSet.ps1](https://github.com/GluttonousSec/Get-PwdLastSet)

## Using the Script:
```powershell
.\Get-PwdLastSet
```

## Purpose
The purpose of the PowerShell script is to retrieve a list of all Active Directory users and their last password change timestamps. This information is valuable for auditing and security purposes, allowing administrators to ensure password policies are being followed and to identify potential security risks.

## How it's Used
To use the script, simply execute it on a machine where the Active Directory module is available. The script first checks if the Active Directory module is installed. If not, it installs it in the current user scope. Then, it retrieves all users from Active Directory and extracts their usernames and last password change timestamps. Finally, it exports this information to a CSV file named "User_Password_Last_Change.csv" in the current directory.

## Example Output
Below is an example of what the output CSV file might look like:

|Username    | LastPasswordChange |
|------------|--------------------|
|john.doe    |2023-12-15 10:30:00 |
|jane.smith  |2023-11-28 15:45:00 |


In this example, the CSV file contains two columns: "Username" and "LastPasswordChange". Each row represents a user in Active Directory, along with the timestamp of their last password change.

## Conclusion
With this simple PowerShell script, administrators can easily track when users last changed their passwords in Active Directory. This automation saves time and effort compared to manual methods, making it a valuable tool for maintaining security and compliance in your organization's IT environment.
